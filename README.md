## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/harryyking/vaurse]
    cd vaurse
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

4.  **Building for Production (to test PWA features):**
    PWA features like service workers are typically active only in a production build.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```
    Then, start the production server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn start
    # or
    pnpm start
    ```
    Open your application in a browser and check the "Application" tab in Developer Tools to inspect the Service Worker and Manifest.

## üåê PWA Notes

* This application utilizes a Service Worker to cache API responses and static assets, enabling a seamless offline experience for character Browse.
* The `manifest.json` file provides metadata for "Add to Home Screen" functionality, allowing the app to be installed like a native application.
* Ensure to build and serve the application in a production environment (`npm run build && npm run start`) to fully test the PWA capabilities, as the service worker is disabled during development.
